# opencv-tutorial
A short tutorial on OpenCV-Python, SIFT feature matching, homography and object classification

## Tutorial index
1. OpenCV-Python Getting Started  
2. Feature Extraction & Matching  
3. Geometric Transformation & Homography  
4. Face Detection with Cascade Classifier  
5. Object Classification with VBoW  
6. (Practice Test) - SIFT Mosaic / Face & Eye Detection  

## Note
This tutorial on OpenCV-Python is based on [OpenCV 3.1.0](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), which is not compatible to the previous 2.X. For example, feature extracting(SIFT, SURF, ...) is moved to the sub-module named `cv2.xfeatures2d` and you should install [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) to use this.
